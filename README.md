# 🧪 musang42-labcadet

Welcome to my personal **coding-lab** - This is my coding test and a personal reflection, tested and build on what I've learnt as a 42-cadet. 

## 👨🏼‍💻 about-this-repo
Hey fellass!! I'm MusangQim, newbie coder and currently create this repository in order to expand my knowledge through small projects, combining functions, and exploring with what I've learnt in order to explore what I could construct independently. It also looks like my journal.

It not about how perfect I am - it's about:
> 🧠 Learning how to think, not copy pasting.
> ⚙️ Trying break the problems into smaller, solving small parts.
> 🔥 Fail, Fail, FAIL, but it also learning progress.

## 🚫  itnot-the-answer
For those Pisciners or Cadets 👋 
Just quick reminder - Finding the answer for certain module? Sorry this repo not give out direct answer or ready-to-copy solutions.
I built this to **understand how things work**, not just finish projects.
Use as **references for learning**.
