# musang42-labcadet
This is my coding test and a personal reflection of what I've learnt as a 42-cadet. I made this repository in order to expand my knowledge through small projects, combining functions, and exploring with what I've learnt in order to explore what I could construct independently. It also looks like my journal as a newbie coder.
